<h1> Monitoring the LAMP stack with Datadog  </h1>

<br />

<p>
The LAMP stack is a set of open-source software used for creating websites and web applications. Lamp is named for its four original components — Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP — and, though evolving to include alternatives like Python and Perl, it has retained its open-source nature. LAMP's cost-effective and flexible approach to web infrastructure makes it the most popular solution stack for hosting websites and web apps.
